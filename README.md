# Food Recognizer App — Dicoding Submission (Belajar Penerapan Machine Learning untuk Flutter)

This repository contains my Submission Project for the **Dicoding — Belajar Penerapan Machine Learning untuk Flutter** course.
The application integrates **Machine Learning**, **LiteRT**, **Firebase ML**, and **Generative AI (Gemini)** to recognize food from an image and display detailed information.

This project fulfills all required criteria across all assessment categories:
✔ Image Capture
✔ Machine Learning Integration
✔ Prediction & Detail Page
✔ External API + Gemini AI enhancement

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 📸 1. Image Capture (Camera & Gallery)

* Take photos directly using **custom camera** (`camera` package)
* Pick image from gallery using `image_picker`
* Built-in **image cropping** for better ML accuracy
* Full permission handling & error handling

---

### 🧠 2. Food Classification with Machine Learning

* Uses **Food Classifier Model (TFLite)** provided by Dicoding
* Inference performed via **LiteRT** for optimized performance
* Supports inferencing via:

  * Photo input
  * Real-time (camera stream) — optional
* **Isolate** implementation to run inference on a background thread → prevents UI freeze
* Firebase ML supported (upload ML model to the cloud)

---

### 📄 3. Prediction & Detail Page

After the ML model predicts the food, a dedicated detail page shows:

* 📷 Food image (user input)
* 🍛 Predicted food name
* 🎯 Confidence score
* 📚 Additional information retrieved from **TheMealDB API**:

  * Meal name
  * Meal image
  * Ingredients list
  * Measurement list
  * Cooking instructions

This section fulfills the *Skilled* criteria.

---

### 🤖 4. Nutrition Info with Gemini AI (Advanced)

The application also fetches **nutrition details** through **Gemini Generative AI**, including:

* Calories
* Carbohydrates
* Fats
* Fiber
* Protein

This allows the app to reach the **Advanced (4 pts)** criteria.
